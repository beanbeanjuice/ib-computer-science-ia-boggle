# Information

This project was made during my time as a final year `IB` student in 2020. The project was finalised some time in 2021, and has been completed. I received a `7` on this project, and *was* quite proud of how it turned out. However, looking at it now, a year later, I can see many flaws that could have been fixed, and am proud of who I am now, and that I can see the old flaws that I have had. Other than this README, I will not be changing anything regarding hte code.

I chose `Boggle` because the plan I had would have involved me learning `MySQL`, as well as teaching myself the basics of password encryption and database caching. I'm glad I am where I am now. Thank you all for reading.
